# Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm RaÅŸit Ä°ri, I'm based in Turkey. I am a passionate software developer or so I think. I enjoy working with exciting technology and
skilled people. Also the rotation of languages and technologies year over year is part of
the job, and I am comfortable knowing that there will be more to come in the years
ahead.
